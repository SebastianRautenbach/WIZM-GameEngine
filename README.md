**This project is how not to write a game engine**
*1. Tightly Coupled*
*2. Overly bloated code*

**Getting Started**
*Step 1: Clone the Repository*
Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client or the command line.

*Step 2: Build the Engine*

---------- FOR VS2022
1. Run "build vs2022.bat"

---------- Other Enviroments
1. Go to the "3D-Game-Engine\RenderEngine" directory
2. Open cmd using selected path
3. Run the following command "vendor\bin\premake\premake5.exe -Enviroment" see https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake/


*Step 3: Run the Engine*
1.  After successfully building and compiling the code, locate the `DLL` folder.
2.  Copy the required DLLs into the `x64/Debug` or `x64/Release` folder, depending on your build configuration.
2.2 Copy DLLs in source folder. 
3.  Launch the engine and start exploring!

**Current state**
- *3D Renderer*: Fully supported 3D rendering with clustered forward rendering for optimal performance.
- *Material Editor*: Intuitive material editor for creating and tweaking materials.
- *Scripting*: Built-in scripting support using AngelScript for creating game logic.
- *Asset Manager*: Robust asset manager for handling textures, models, and other game assets.
- *Sound System*: Comprehensive sound system for creating immersive audio experiences.
- *Runtime*: Supports runtime loading and unloading of assets, scripts, and other game data.

**Whats to come**
I want the engine to support a layer system where all scenes can be layered on top of each other making it more modular.I am also currently busy working on the batch renderer
